## Game Rules

The rules of the Snake Game are simple:

- Control the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
- The snake starts with a length of 1.
- Collect food (represented as a red square) to grow the snake.
- Avoid running into walls or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
2. The snake will start moving in the chosen direction.
3. Collect the red squares (food) to make the snake grow.
4. Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.
5. Try to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can.
